        <h1><u>Why Bitcoin's PoW solves the oracle problem</u></h1>
        (from Coco_Ardo's Twitter 07Jan2023)<br><br><br>

        <h4>
        So what is the oracle problem (op)?

        The op is trying to bring real world information into a digital information network (eg Bitcoin) without 
        relying on one or multiable trusted parties (called a oracle).<br><br>

        So what do I mean by real world informations?
        When I ask another peer in a network what 2+3 is I can always #verify the result on my own. 
        But when I gonna ask what the current weather in London is I have to trust that peer or ask 
        other trusted peers such as british news channels. <br><br>

        So to conclude #math is conciderd trustless.<br><br>

        So what is PoW? PoW means proof of work. Its a method to proof that one of your peers did work 
        without trusting someone.<br><br>

        But how does it work trustless you might ask? We can't just settup a camera in their room and 
        watch them work since it would be easy to cheat on it. And the camera would be a trusted partie again. <br><br>

        The answere again is #math. But we first need to learn a little bit about algorithm based hashfunctions. 
        Bitcoins PoW uses mainly sha256.
        The most important part about hashfunctions (here) are that they are not reversable calculations.<br><br>

        What does that mean? When I calculate 2+3=5 I can allways reverse that with enought informations.<br>

        If I don't know the 2nd number: <br>
        2+?=5 <br>
        i can reverse that by calculation -2 on both sides:<br>
        ?=5-2 .<br>
        That lets me know that ?=3 .<br>
        But you can't do that with hashfunctions.<br>

        The hashfunction Sha1 with an input of the number 137 looks like this:
        Sha-1(137) = e1a864f0b77f6c89794827a9035355dc8d052622<br><br>

        But just a small change to 138 gives you a complety diffrent result:
        Sha-1(138)= 56ad4d4deaec98465c419b4a8ea7bfc1ed38c4d9<br><br>

        Since there is no way to tell if your input was below/above 100 or if it even was a number, because you 
        can input text as well, the only method of getting the input, when you only know the result, is by trying 
        out one input after the other.<br><br>

        Test it out:<br>

        How does Bitcoins PoW use the hashfunctions? When you give someone the task to get you a specific result of sha-1 
        they have to guess a lot of inputs to get the result. This is conciderd work. <br><br>

        Getting the right input is the proof that your peer did work for that. (or that they were lucky)<br>
        Their solution of the input however is quick verifyable, since calculating only one hash takes far less than a second.<br><br>

        Bitcoin actually however uses a range of results that are concider the right result (Number must start with x amount of 0's). 
        Thats how Bitcoin makes sure you need to provode real work to secure or attack bitcoin.<br><br>

        But wait?! <br>
        You didn't explain how I can get the weather in London"<br><br>

        Your right. Because getting these type of informations trustless is impossible. Work is the only realworld 
        information you can get trustless.<br><br>

        *Note that you can reduce the trust by having several validators, but trust is allways a terrible risk. 
        No matter how little. Trust = information centralisation.<br><br>

        Examples of real world informations:<br>
        Price of stocks, stablecoins (price of a currency), a picture, music, videos.<br><br>

        #Cryptocurrencies that use oracles are relying on trust and are doomed to get centralised. When they claim 
        to be decentralised you now know they are a #scam.<br><br>

        Distributed doesn't equal decentralised.
