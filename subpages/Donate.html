            <br><h3>The onion routing (TOR) <button onclick="hide('d3')">v</button></h3>
            <div id="d3">
                Tor is free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication.
                It directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay 
                network, consisting of more than seven thousand relays, to conceal a 
                user's location and usage from anyone performing network surveillance or 
                traffic analysis. Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace a user's 
                Internet activity. Tor's intended use is to protect the personal privacy 
                of its users, as well as their freedom and ability to communicate 
                confidentially through IP address anonymity using Tor exit nodes.

                WikiLeaks is an international non-profit organisation that publishes news 
                leaks and classified media provided by anonymous sources. Its website 
                stated in 2015 that it had released online 10 million documents since 
                beginning in 2006 in Iceland. Julian Assange, an Australian Internet 
                activist, is generally described as its founder and director and is 
                currently fighting extradition to the United States over his work with 
                WikiLeaks. Since September 2018, Kristinn Hrafnsson has served as its 
                editor-in-chief.

            <div id="d5">
                Tails, or The Amnesic Incognito Live System, is a security-focused Debian-based 
                Linux distribution aimed at preserving privacy and anonymity. It connects to the
                 Internet exclusively through the anonymity network Tor. The system is designed 
                 to be booted as a live DVD or live USB, and leaves no digital footprint on the 
                 machine unless explicitly told to do so. It can also be run as a virtual machine, 
                 with some additional security risks. The Tor Project provided financial support 
                 for its development in the beginnings of the project, and continues to do so 
                 alongside numerous corporate and anonymous sponsors.

                The goal of SeedSigner is to lower the cost and complexity of Bitcoin 
                multi-signature wallet use. To accomplish this goal, SeedSigner offers anyone 
                the opportunity to build a verifiably air-gapped, stateless Bitcoin signing 
                device using inexpensive, publicly available hardware components (usually < $50). 
                SeedSigner helps users save with Bitcoin by assisting with trustless private key 
                generation and multi-signature wallet setup, and helps users transact with Bitcoin 
                via a secure, air-gapped QR-exchange signing model.
