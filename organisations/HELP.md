## Where to start
The easiest way to help is to have a look at the big list (organisations/implementations.html) of content I collectet and sort them to the diffrent pages.
GUI changes are welcome as well.

## Goals
* Having a Website were unexpirienced and expirienced users are able to find **everything** they want to know about Bitcoin. 
* Even if they can't find the informations on BitcoinOverview.org, at least they then know where to find it somewhere else.
* Providing the source information. No self created content.
* Beeing some kind of archiv.
## Rules

1. BitcoinOverview.org doesn't allow the promotion of Fiat or Shitcoin related content.
* That includes trading.
* Altcoins are shitcoins.
* Informational content is ok, as long as it had an important impact on Bitcoin.
2. BitcoinOverview.org doesn't allow illegal content.
3. BitcoinOverview.org is restricted by the terms of use of the hosting provider.
