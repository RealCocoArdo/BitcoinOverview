# Bitcoin Overview

## Disclamer 
### Bitcoinoverview.org is currently not hosted
I had some issues setting up the DNS etc.. Help is appriciated.
### The Website isn't finished yet
The website has still many basic construction sites. Empty containers or notes that need more attention.
And with the growth of content around Bitcoin it probably will never be "finished"
### FOSS
This website is entirly free open source software. However the backgroundpictures are from [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/). They need to be credited.

If you want to you can add content to the original Website [BitcoinOverview.org](https://BitcoinOverview.org) or host your own fork of it.
